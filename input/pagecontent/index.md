## Te Whatu Ora Shared Care FHIR API Implementation Guide

This is the Implementation Guide for the [HL7® FHIR©](http://hl7.org/fhir) interface.  

The *Te Whatu Ora Shared Care API* covers two solution areas at present:

1. National Shared Care Plan service used to coordinate community care.
1. Rheumatic fever patient register and care plan for coordinated rheumatic fever care including secondary prophylaxis (preventative treatment) appointments

This IG brings together all the artifacts necessary to understand and use the FHIR API.

It is based on [FHIR R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/) and NZBase IG 2.0.
