### Warning: The IG official Url will be changing
  
The official Url of this Implementation Guide is expected to change in early 2024.

The Url domain will move to `digital.health.nz` and the IG will likely be renamed.

Developers of applications that consume this API are advised to make the official Url base configurable in their applications -- the base Url is currently `https://build.fhir.org/ig/tewhatuora/cinc-fhir-ig/`
